### Planning 
I've laid out a pseudo-code plan in JS to break down the various steps to take.
Then worked on each one by one

### Known Bugs

Cells are still clickable after a player wins.
It's currently not mobile-responsive.

### Future features/Wishlist

- A more visually pleasing CSS

### My experience developing the game (Optional)

- Huge learning curve on how to reference innerText to a function
